Snake Game with AIs
===================

General
-------------------
  I wrote this game was for practising "OpenGL" & "AI" programming.<br/>
  Well, thoughts are easy, but coding is a bit hard for newbie. XD<br/>

Build
-------------------
### Linux
  I wrote all of this on openSUSE, thus Linux users are able to build it easily.<br/>
		make<br/>
  Just that easy! But you will fail without libGL, libGLU, libglut and libfreetype's devel vers.<br/>
  Note: if you installed both freetype and freetype2, you may meet some collision error.<br/>
		mv /usr/include/freetype2/freetype/ /usr/include/freetype2/freetype_bak/<br/>
		ln -s /usr/include/freetype2/freetype/ /usr/include/freetype/<br/>
  That's harmless, in my opnion. :)<br/>

### Win32
  After I wrote all codes over, I will adjust my sources, then you will see a tutorial.<br/>

### MacOS
  I will try to borrow a MacBook and finish this job. XD<br/>

Rule
-------------------
  Compete with AI, you should eat more and live longer than others.<br/>
